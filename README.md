Python Code for [Symbolic Computation of Dynamics on Smooth Manifolds](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-43089-4_22) and based on the original scala version https://github.com/HybridRobotics/dynamics_on_manifolds

### supported data types

- Scalars
- Column vectors (Nx1)
- Square matrices (NxN)

Note, N is equal for vectors and matrices, more precisely we assume N = 3
